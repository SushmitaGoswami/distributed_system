## What is distributed system?
Distributed system is a system of set of different processes running on different computers communicating with each other via the network, it may share the same state or work together to achieve a common goal.

## Motivation behind distributed system design
There are several limitation of a centralized system. Followings are the some of those.
- **Vertical scaling** is limited by the performance and storage capacity of a single machine.
- **Single point of failure** occurs if there is no failover set up available.
- **Security breach**
-  **High Latency** or poor user experience.

**Quiz Time** - So, if more than one processes running on the same machine while sharing the same memory, cpu and all underlying resources provided by OS, will it be a distributed set up?

**Answer** - No.
